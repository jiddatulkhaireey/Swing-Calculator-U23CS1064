Advanced Swing Calculator
This is a feature-rich Java Swing calculator application that supports both basic and advanced mathematical operations. It provides a user-friendly interface with several scientific functions and memory features which includes:
	Basic Arithmetic: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
	Square Root (√): Calculates the square root of a number.
	Exponentiation (^): Raises a number to the power of another.
	Logarithmic Function (log): Calculates the base-10 logarithm of a number.
	Exponential Function (exp): Calculates the value of e^x.
	Memory Functions:
	Memory Clear (MC): Clears the stored memory.
	Memory Recall (MR): Recalls the stored memory value.
	Memory Add (M+): Adds the current displayed value to memory.
	Clear Entry (CE): Clears the current input without affecting the full display.
	Error Handling: The calculator handles division by zero and invalid operations gracefully.

How To Run
To run this program, follow the instructions below:
	Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-swing-calculator.git

	Navigate to the project folder:
cd advanced-swing-calculator

	Compile the program: Make sure you have JDK installed on your system. If not, download it from the official Oracle JDK website.
In the terminal, navigate to the folder containing the Java files and compile the program using:
javac AdvancedSwingCalculator.java

	Run the program: After compiling, you can run the program with:
java AdvancedSwingCalculator

Usage
	Basic Operations: Click on the buttons to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
	Scientific Functions:
	Square Root: Click √ to compute the square root of the entered number.
	Exponentiation: Click ^ to raise a number to the power of another.
	Logarithm: Click log to compute the base-10 logarithm.
	Exponential Function: Click exp to compute e^x.
	Memory Functions:
	Memory Add (M+): Adds the displayed value to memory.
	Memory Recall (MR): Recalls the stored memory value.
	Memory Clear (MC): Clears the memory.
	Clear Entry (CE): Clears the current input (without resetting the entire display).
	Error Handling: The calculator will display Error if an invalid operation is attempted, such as division by zero.

Requirements
	Java Version: JDK 8 or higher
	Swing Library: The application uses Java's built-in Swing library for the graphical user interface.

Acknowledgements
	The program was built using Java Swing and AWT for the graphical user interface.
	Thanks to OpenJDK for providing the Java platform.
